What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
HTML5 semantic tags not only divides the content into meaningful chunks,
but it is also used by the different device types on how to display content,
especially for assistive technology.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
For me, <main> is most useful for mobile technology and reader technology.  It helps
browsers to identify the most important part of the page. I also find the <aside> very useful,
as it helps identify content that are not directly part of the main content but are very much
relevant to it.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays the elements from top to bottom if no css is applied to it.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
While I use Atom, I learned that with Sublime, you can create snippets.
I learned from our guide that I can install a package in Atom that I can open the html
code to preview to a browser. Neat!

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
To be honest, not really, and that's because there are completion/snippet packages
available these days that are far more efficient and are ready out of the box.
However, it might still come in handy when I'm writing repetitive code for
a project that I'll be working on in the future, so it's good to know that
it's there to help me out and save me time.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
I really thought that the concepts are very straightforward and I did not feel lost at all.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I am sure that while I think I understand the concepts, there will always
be more to learn.  I know that using them in the future will lead to deeper
understanding and appreciation.  So I will just have to make sure to use them whenever I
create html projects and discuss them with my cohort.
