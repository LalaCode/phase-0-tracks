Plan
1. Look up cheat sheets and documentation.
2. Look up sample uses of jquery and how others have applied it in thier projects.
3. Find jquery specific forums.
4. Experiment: replicate things I have seen in my research and then try making my own projects. 

Response
I think this is a good plan because it will introduce me to the topic but not overwhelm me with information.  I think it is important to see real world applications of the things we are learning, and the problems we may encounter, which is why I think having the forums as a resource is good. Of course breaks are important for working on anything, as it gives our brain a bit of a reset and allows what we have just learned to settle in.
