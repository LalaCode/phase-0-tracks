Plan
1. Look up cheat sheets and documentation.
2. Look up sample uses of jquery and how others have applied it in thier projects.
3. Find jquery specific forums.
4. Experiment: replicate things I have seen in my research and then try making my own projects. 

Response
I think this is a good plan because it will introduce me to the topic but not overwhelm me with information.  I think it is important to see real world applications of the things we are learning, and the problems we may encounter, which is why I think having the forums as a resource is good. Of course breaks are important for working on anything, as it gives our brain a bit of a reset and allows what we have just learned to settle in. 

For this week I have been extremely busy with moving from Europe to USA for the program and as such have not had as much time as I would have liked to work on the assignments this week.  I found that reading over a few cheat sheets was helpful but then decided to use Codecademy to walk me through a simple project that I could submit for this assignment.  I don't think it is necessarily the ideal way to learn but it made sense based on my current time constraints and still gave me a good introduction to jquery.
