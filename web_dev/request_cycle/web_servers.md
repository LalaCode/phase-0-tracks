**Linux**
Linux is designed with a minimalist design and operation concept that assumes the user knows what they are doing and therefore is very powerful, allowing the user easy access to all parts of the system with complete control. 

**VPS**
A VPS is part of a partitioned physical server that serves the same function as a dedicated physical server but instead exists virtually as software running your same OS. The benefits of using a VPS are:

1. Smaller carbon footprint - no dedicated physical server and all of the energy consumption required (sharing the footprint)
2. Cost effective - cheaper than a dedicated physical server
3. More control compared to shared servers

**Root user on Linux**
It could be a bad idea to run as the root on Linux because you run a greater risk of harming the core OS.  Since Linux gives you full control, there is also an associated risk.  It is better to run applications on a user level and make admin tasks on the root level and only as needed. While operating at the root level, all applications are accessible at that level and are vunerable to bugs, viruses, etc.
