**Linux**
Linux is designed with a minimalist design and operation concept that assumes the user knows what they are doing and therefore is very powerful, allowing the user easy access to all parts of the system with complete control. 

**VPS**
A VPS serves the same function as a dedicated physical server but instead exists virtually as software running your same OS. The benefits of using a VPS are:

1. smaller carbon footprint - no physical server and all of the energy consumption needed (sharing the footprint)
2. cost effective - cheaper than a dedicated server
3. complete control compared to shared servers
