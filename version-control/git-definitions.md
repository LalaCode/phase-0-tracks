# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?  
  *Version control is a system designed to manage changes made to a file. It is a god-send solution that allows a user to review and compare the current and past versions of a file and be able to revert back to a previous version if necessary. More excitingly, it can allow and prevent other users to perform revisions to the same file and can also track the authors of the revisions made. It makes collaboration easy, prevents costly mistakes and eliminates the need to start over a project from scratch.*  


* What is a branch and why would you use one?  
  *With Git, a project can have several duplicates of itself that can develop in different directions and pace.  These duplicates are called branches. A typical use case is when the main branch, referred to as the master, is treated as the working copy of the project. The goal is to prevent the corruption of the master. In order to protect this working copy, a branch is typically created in scenarios when a user is implementing a major change to a project. If the branch is tested and proves to be a success, it can then be merged to the master branch. Otherwise, it will be very easy to abort the changes by deleting the branch and the master copy remains untouched and working.*  
  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  
* What is a merge conflict?
