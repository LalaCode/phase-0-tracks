# Git Definitions

**Instructions:** Define each of the following Git concepts.

**What is version control?**

* Version control is the process of creating multiple versions of ongoing work.  It is a method to save and manage changes.

**Why is it useful?**

* Version control is extremely useful as it is a way to experiment with a project while not harming or altering a master file.  This is useful because people can work collaboratively on different machines, experiment with a variety of solutions on a single problem and most important, one can always revert back to the original document if need be, or merge the new progress into the master.

**What is a branch and why would you use one?**

* A branch is essentially a version of the master file.  It allows you to make changes tot he master file without actually altering the master. Branches are useful when working on teams, as each person can work on their own branch and then the changes can be reviewed b the team before merging them with the master.

**What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**

* A commit is a save in git.  It saves the change with a time and stamp and a message as to what happened in this iteration of the project.  A good commit message is specific.  Tells the reader exactly what was changed and perhaps also indicates the problem that the commit is a solution for.

**What is a merge conflict?**

* A merge conflict simply means there was an unresolvable issue in merging branches.  There are a variety of reasons for a merge conflict but they can be resolved manually.
