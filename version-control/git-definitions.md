# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?  
  *Version control is a system designed to manage changes made to a file. It is a god-send solution that allows a user to review and compare the current and past versions of a file and be able to revert back to a previous version if necessary. More excitingly, it can allow and prevent other users to perform revisions to the same file and can also track the authors of the revisions made. It makes collaboration easy, prevents costly mistakes and eliminates the need to start over a project from scratch.*  


* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  
* What is a merge conflict?
